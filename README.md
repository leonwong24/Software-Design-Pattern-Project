# 2D Wave Survival Shooting Game
This is a Java project for IT Tralee semester 3 OOP module. By the end of the semester I hope to create a simple 2d java game, by watching youtube tutorial series from user CodeNMore: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEKs-3GhVKQ&list=PLah6faXAgguMnTBs3JnEJY0shAc18XYQZ 


## About the project

A Java project for IT Tralee semester 3 Object Oriented Programing module made from October 2018 to Dec 2018. This project consist team member of one (which is me) that implemented the game UI, logic , and spawning enemies that will chase my character endlessly throughout the game.

This project is never going to be happened without the help from 2D Java game tutorial series created by CodeNMore:

## IDE or Text Editor 

I was taught with IntelliJ thus this project was created using IntelliJ but you can always you any IDE you like.

## Installation
1. Open IntelliJ
2. Select "Check out from Version Control" and pick "Git"
3. 


Although this project has been submitted for the Object Oriented Programming, the project still hasn't finished as I wanted to be.
The unfinished part of the project is wave design, character levelling and check point saving
